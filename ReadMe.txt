This is meant to be an entry project to show the differences and insight regarding Salaries in IT, most specificly for Data Analysts, Data Engineers and Data Scientists roles.
Among all the other roles that appears in the spreadhseet I choose to target these three specific ones due to the more balanced amount of records, which make the analysis more compact and accurate.

In this repository you can find the following files:

1. ReadMe
2. Salary_Analaysis_in_IT.pbix - the full Power BI report
3. ds_salaries.csv - the dataset used in this project downloaded from Kaggle

The Project:

The focal point of this project is to show the total and average salary for all the three roles through the years 2020 to 2023 using several visualizations like Cards, a bar chart, a line chart and a donut chart.
All is combined with a slicer that helps filtering salaries for a specific role and year.

Visualization:

1. Cards: give us a primary, straight and clear information of the sum of salaries and the average salaries.
2. Slicer: help filtering the role we are looking for
3. Bar chart: it visualize the role's average salary per year with an additional information on the Experience level
4. Line chart: show us the avegare salary fluctuation starting from 2020 through 2023
5. Donut chart: by default it display the amount of employed people for the years from 2020 to 2023
